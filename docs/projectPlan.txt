# Stock Analyzer Web Application - Updated Comprehensive Plan

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React.js with TypeScript
- Material-UI or Ant Design for UI components
- Redux for state management
- D3.js or Chart.js for data visualization

### Backend
- Python with Flask
- Flask-CORS for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
- Flask-SocketIO for real-time communication
- Flask-SQLAlchemy for database ORM

### Database
- PostgreSQL for relational data storage
- Redis for caching and session management

### Machine Learning
- Python with scikit-learn and TensorFlow/Keras
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis

### Cloud Services (AWS or Google Cloud)
- EC2/Compute Engine for hosting
- S3/Cloud Storage for file storage
- RDS for managed database
- CloudFront/Cloud CDN for content delivery

### DevOps
- Docker for containerization
- GitHub Actions or Jenkins for CI/CD
- Kubernetes for orchestration (if time allows)

### Additional Technologies
- JWT for authentication
- Celery for task queuing and background jobs
- Elasticsearch for fast, full-text search capabilities (if time allows)

## Features
[Features remain the same as in the original plan]

## Development Plan (10-day sprint)

### Days 1-2: Setup and Basic Structure
- Set up project repository and structure
- Initialize frontend with React
- Set up Flask backend and project structure
- Set up PostgreSQL database and design schema
- Implement basic user authentication with Flask-JWT

### Days 3-4: Core Functionality
- Develop stock data upload and storage functionality
- Create basic portfolio management features
- Set up real-time data updates with Flask-SocketIO
- Begin implementing data visualization components

### Days 5-6: Machine Learning Integration
- Implement basic stock prediction model using scikit-learn
- Integrate ML predictions with Flask backend
- Create frontend components to display predictions
- Set up Celery for background processing of ML tasks

### Days 7-8: Advanced Features and Cloud Deployment
- Implement automated trading signals
- Develop portfolio optimization feature
- Set up cloud infrastructure (AWS/Google Cloud)
- Deploy application to cloud environment
- Implement CI/CD pipeline

### Days 9-10: Optimization and Finalization
- Optimize application for performance and scalability
- Implement caching with Redis
- Conduct thorough testing (unit, integration, end-to-end)
- Finalize documentation
- Prepare presentation or demo of the application

## Development Workflow
1. Use Git for version control with feature branching
2. Implement features in 1-2 day sprints
3. Regular code reviews between team members
4. Continuous integration with automated tests
5. Staged deployment (dev, staging, production)

## Additional Considerations
- Security: Implement data encryption, secure API endpoints, and follow OWASP guidelines
- Scalability: Design the application to handle potential growth in users and data
- User Experience: Focus on creating an intuitive and responsive interface
- Documentation: Maintain clear documentation for codebase, API, and deployment process
- Testing: Implement comprehensive test coverage for critical components

This updated plan leverages the power of Python for both backend development and machine learning tasks, providing a more integrated approach to building a sophisticated stock analysis web application. It demonstrates proficiency in full-stack development, data science, cloud computing, and the complete software development lifecycle.
